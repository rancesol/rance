Below you will find the courses Rance has taught.
When possible the courses may be accompanied by scans of the teaching notes used.

***University at Buffalo***
**Introductory Physics I (PHY101):**
An algebra based physics course headed by Prof. Surajit Sen.
The course covered at an introductory level both one and two dimensional kinematics, forces, energy/momentum conservation, and thermodynamics.
Also an experimental and free homework system was developed (by Dr. Rahul Kashyap) and trouble shot (by Dr. Rahul Kashyap and Rance).

**Introductory Physics I (PHY107):**
A calculus based physics course headed by a rotating set of Professors.
The course covered at an introductory level both one and two dimensional kinematics, forces, energy/momentum conservation, gravity, and pressure.

**Introductory Physics II (PHY108):**
A calculus based physics course headed by a rotating set of Professors.
The course covered at an introductory level Coulomb's law, electric and magnetic fields, and electrical circuits (i.e. resistors, capacitors, and inductors along with RC, RL, RLC, and AC circuits).

**Honors Introductory Physics I (PHY117):**
A calculus based physics course (at a higher level than PHY107/108) taught by Prof. Dejan Stojkovic.
The course covered classical mechanics (i.e. 1D/2D kinematics, forces, work, and Lagrangians) and special relativity (i.e. Lorentz transforms, time dilation, length contraction, and people on fast trains).
