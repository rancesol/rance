My name is Rance Solomon. Me in a nutshell: cramped.

I am currently a PhD candidate in physics at the University at Buffalo. My research area is flushed out in more detail under the <a href="https://rancesol.github.io/research/">Research tab</a>.

I was born and raised in Manchester, TN, USA, home of Itchycoo and Bonnaroo. Up until university I had intended to go into illustration, but the arts are very difficult so I made a switch to physics. Now life is much easier.

More content will be added to this page once I reach my midlife crisis. Until then, this much should suffice.
