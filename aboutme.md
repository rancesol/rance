My name is Rance, a boy of Manchester, TN. There is not much you need to learn of my personal life -- particularly from a website. But siffice it to say that at any given moment I am happily doing one of three things: spending time with my wife, doing research, or listening to music.

I also use to be really into <a href="https://hitrecord.org/users/CoAM/records">illustration</a>.

More content will be added to this page once I reach my midlife crisis. Until then, this much should be enough.
