subtitle: In case you need to know

My name is Rance Matthew Solomon. I was born in the trees of Manchester, TN, USA. There is not much you need to know about me personally but a few neat facts:
<li> I can wiggle my ears. <li><br>
<li> I usd to be into <a href="https://hitrecord.org/users/CoAM/records">illustration</a>. <li><br>
That turned out to be a much shorter list than I was hoping for.
But more content will be added as I approch my midlife crisis. It won't be long now.
