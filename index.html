Bonjour. As of the latest update I am a Ph.D. in physics working in cosmology.
Starting January 2023 I will be working as a postdoc at Laboratorie d'Annecy de Physique des Particules (<a href="https://lapp.in2p3.fr/">LAPP</a>) in the Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC).
My primary responsibility will be in reduction of galaxy cluster mass estimation errors and cosmological constraints from cluster abundances for the coming Legacy of Space and Time Survey (<a href="https://www.lsst.org/">LSST</a>) at the Vera Rubin Observatory.
I will also be partially responsible for commissioning the observatory's focal plane at the pixel level.
This site is currently being updated.

<li> My research interests are cosmology, particle physics, and general relativity.

<li> During my PhD candidacy I have taught a number of courses.
  Please see the <a href="https://rancesol.github.io/teaching/">Teaching tab</a> for more information. </li><br>
