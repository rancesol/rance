Welcome. As of the latest update to this website I am a PhD candidate at SUNY at Buffalo under the advisement of
<a href="http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~ds77/">Prof. Dejan Stojkovic</a>.

- My research interests are cosmology, particle physics, and general relativity. For more detailed information please see the Research tab.
- During my PhD candidacy I have taught a number of courses. Please see the Teaching tab for more information.
- If for some strange reason you are interested in my non-research related doings see the About Me tab.
