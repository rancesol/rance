This webpage is a working summary of some chosen aspects of Rance Solomon.  

Rance is a postdoc at <a href="https://lapp.in2p3.fr/">L.A.P.P.</a> in Annecy, France.
He obtained his Bachelor of Arts from Middle Tennessee State University in 2015 followed by a Ph.D. in physics from the University at Buffalo in 2022.
This of course follows his birth from Judy Solomon (in minor collaboration with Scott Solomon) in Manchester, Tennessee in 1992.  

His research focuses on the study of the Universe's accelerated expansion through observational cosmology.
Most notable in his work is the use of quasars as standard candles (independent) and cosmological constraints from galaxy clusters with the first Rubin data (with the <a href="https://www.lsst.org/">LSST</a> collaboration).  

More details on these aspects can be found in the navbar links. 
As Rance approaches his midlife crisis or a job change he will further update this page.
