***Standard Candle Quasars***
Quasars are among the most luminous objects in the known universe making them also among the farthest observable objects.
To date quasars have been observed at redshifts $z>7$ with a peak in population density around $z=2$.
Combined with their long lifetimes, quasars have the potential to be exceptional contributions to the cosmic distance ladder and to enable us to put new constraints on the current matter density, $\Omega_M$, and expansion rate, $H_0$, of the universe.

The trouble however is that quasars range in luminosity over several orders of magnitude.
So in order to add quasars to the distance ladder we would need to standardize them some how.
That is to say, we need to find some relation of parameters in the light coming from the quasar that would allow us to determine with good precission the exact luminosity of the quasar.
Once we determine how luminous the quasar should be we can relate it back to how luminous we observe it which gives us a measure of the distance to the quasar.
There have been many attempts towards finding such a relation but most have been plagued by large dispersion making determination of the distance very inaccurate.
