<a href="https://rancesol.github.io/standard_candle_QSOs/">***Standard Candle Quasars***</a> :
From quasar variability we are able to determine its absolute magnitude, making quasars a new standardized candle and extending the cosmic distance ladder out well beyond a redshift of z = 2.

<a href="https://rancesol.github.io/galaxy_clusters/">***Galaxy Clusters***</a> :
Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally bound structures in the universe, providing one of the strongest probes for dark energy.

<a href="https://rancesol.github.io/standard_candle_QSOs/">***Dark Matter Halo Mass Estimation -- Triaxial Correction***</a> :
Modelling the mass of dark matter halos from weak lensing signals is often done by assuming a spherical halo, but in general we exect a triaxial structure.
This biases the measured halo mass by a few percent which is a level of precision we expect in the upcoming LSST run.
