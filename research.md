***Standard Candle Quasars***
Quasars are among the most luminous objects in the known universe making them also among the farthest observable objects. To date quasars have been observed at redshifts $$z>7$$ with a peak in population density around $$z=2$$. Combined with their exceptionally long lifetimes, quasars have the potential to be exceptional contributions to the cosmic distance ladder and put new constraints on the current matter density, $$\Omega_M$$, and expansion rate, $$H_0$$, of the universe.
